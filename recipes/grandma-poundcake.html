            <p>Now giving it out to the public so you can all try this greatness.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>â…” cup milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 8x4-inch loaf pans, then line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat in flour alternately with milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter evenly into the prepared loaf pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 70 minutes.</li>
                <li>Run a small knife around the edges of each pan. Allow cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert, peel off the parchment, and cool completely on wire racks.</li>
            </ol>
